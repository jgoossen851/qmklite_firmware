Quantum MK Firmware
================================
This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk_keyboard firmware](http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR controller, and more specifically, the OLKB product line.


### Getting started

You can create your own Quantum-based project by using `./new_project.sh <project_name>`, which will create `/keyboard/<project_name>` with all the necessary components for a Quantum project.

You have access to a bunch of goodies! Check out the Makefile to enable/disable some of the features. Uncomment the `#` to enable them. Setting them to `no` does nothing and will only confuse future you.

    BACKLIGHT_ENABLE = yes # Enable keyboard backlight functionality
    MIDI_ENABLE = yes      # MIDI controls
    # UNICODE_ENABLE = yes # Unicode support
    BLUETOOTH_ENABLE = yes # Enable Bluetooth with the Adafruit EZ-Key HID

### Mod shortcuts

* `LSFT(kc)` - applies left shift to *kc* - `S(kc)` is an alias
* `RSFT(kc)` - applies right shift to *kc*
* `LCTL(kc)` - applies left control to *kc*
* `RCTL(kc)` - applies right control to *kc*
* `LALT(kc)` - applies left alt to *kc*
* `RALT(kc)` - applies right alt to *kc*
* `LGUI(kc)` - applies left gui (command/win) to *kc*
* `RGUI(kc)` - applies right gui (command/win) to *kc*

You can also use more than one, like this:

    LALT(LGUI(KC_ESC))

The following shortcuts automatically add `LSFT()` to keycodes to get commonly used symbols. Their long names (see `quantum/keymap_common.h`) are also availble.

    KC_TILD  ~
    KC_EXLM  !
    KC_AT    @
    KC_HASH  #
    KC_DLR   $
    KC_PERC  %
    KC_CIRC  ^
    KC_AMPR  &
    KC_ASTR  *
    KC_LPRN  (
    KC_RPRN  )
    KC_UNDS  _
    KC_PLUS  +
    KC_LCBR  {
    KC_RCBR  }
    KC_PIPE  |
    KC_COLN  :

### Function shortcuts

Instead of using `FNx`, you can use `F(x)` - the benefit here is being able to use more than 32 function layers (up to 4096), if you happen to need them.

There are also keycode shortcuts for common actions:

* `MO(layer)` - momentary switch to *layer*
* `DF(layer)` - sets default layer to *layer*
* `TG(layer)` - toggle between the current layer and *layer*
* `MT(mod, kc)` - is *mod* when held, and *kc* when tapped
  * `CTL_T(kc)` - is LCTL when held and *kc* when tapped 
  * `SFT_T(kc)` - is LSFT when held and *kc* when tapped 
  * `ALT_T(kc)` - is LALT when held and *kc* when tapped 
  * `GUI_T(kc)` - is LGUI when held and *kc* when tapped 
  * `ALL_T(kc)` - is Hyper (all mods) when held and *kc* when tapped 
* `LT(layer, kc)` - momentary switch to *layer* when held, and *kc* when tapped

These functions work the same way that their `ACTION_*` functions do, and will require KC_TRNS on the layer being switched to - check out the default keymap for an example.

### Additional keycodes for software-implemented layouts (Colemak, Dvorak, etc)

Everything is assuming you're in Qwerty (in software) by default, but there is built-in support for using a Colemak or Dvorak layout by including this at the top of your keymap:

     #include "keymap_<layout>.h"
     
Where <layout> is "colemak" or "dvorak". After including this line, you will get access to:
 
 * `CM_*` for all of the Colemak-equivalent characters
 * `DV_*` for all of the Dvorak-equivalent characters
 
These implementations assume you're using Colemak or Dvorak on your OS, not on your keyboard - this is referred to as a software-implemented layout. If your computer is in Qwerty and your keymap is in Colemak or Dvorak, this is referred to as a firmware-implemented layout, and you won't need these features. 

To give an example, if you're using software-implemented Colemak, and want to get an `F`, you would use `CM_F` - `KC_F` under these same circumstances would result in `T`.

### Additional language support

In `quantum/keymap_extras/`, you'll see various language files - these work the same way as the alternative layout ones do. Most are defined by their two letter country/language code followed by an underscore and a 4-letter abbrivation of its name. `FR_UGRV` which will result in a `Ã¹` when using a software-implemented AZERTY layout. It's currently difficult to send such characters in just the firmware (but it's being worked on - see Unicode support).

### Unicode support

You can currently send 4 hex digits with your OS-specific modifier key (RALT for OSX with the "Unicode Hex Input" layout) - this is currently limited to supporting one OS at a time, and requires a recompile for switching. 8 digit hex codes are being worked on. The keycode function is `UC(n)`, where *n* is a 4 digit hexidecimal. Enable from the Makefile.

### Macro shortcuts

Instead of using the `ACTION_MACRO` function, you can simply use `M(n)` to access macro *n* - *n* will get passed into the `action_get_macro` as the `id`, and you can use a switch statement to filter them. This gets called on the keydown and keyup, so you'll need to use an if statement testing `record->event.pressed` (see keymap_default.c).

### Other keyboard shortcut keycodes

* `RESET` - puts the MCU in DFU mode for flashing new firmware (with `make dfu`)
* `DEBUG` - the firmware into debug mode - you'll need hid_listen to see things
* `BL_ON` - turns the backlight on
* `BL_OFF` - turns the backlight off
* `BL_<n>` - sets the backlight to level *n*
* `BL_INC` - increments the backlight level by one
* `BL_DEC` - decrements the backlight level by one
* `BL_TOGG` - toggles the backlight
* `BL_STEP` - steps through the backlight levels

Enable the backlight from the Makefile.


### MIDI functionalty

This is still a WIP, but check out `quantum/keymap_midi.c` to see what's happening. Enable from the Makefile.

### Bluetooth functionality

This requires [some hardware changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/3psx0q/the_planck_keyboard_with_bluetooth_guide_and/?ref=search_posts), but can be enabled via the Makefile. The firmware will still output characters via USB, so be aware of this when charging via a computer. It would make sense to have a switch on the Bluefruit to turn it off at will.

Build Firmware and Program Controller
-------------------------------------
See [doc/build.md](doc/build.md), or the README in the particular keyboard/* folder.



Change your keymap
------------------
See [doc/keymap.md](doc/keymap.md).



Magic Commands
--------------
To see help press `Magic` + `H`.

`Magic` key combination is `LShift` + `RShift` in many project, but `Power` key on ADB converter. 
`Magic` keybind can be vary on each project, check `config.h` in project directory.

Following commands can be also executed with `Magic` + key. In console mode `Magic` keybind is not needed.

    ----- Command Help -----
    c:      enter console mode
    d:      toggle debug enable
    x:      toggle matrix debug
    k:      toggle keyboard debug

    4/F4:   switch to Layer4
    PScr:   power down/remote wake-up
    Caps:   Lock Keyboard(Child Proof)
    Paus:   jump to bootloader



Boot Magic Configuration - Virtual DIP Switch
---------------------------------------------
Boot Magic are executed during boot up time. Press Magic key below then plug in keyboard cable.
Note that you must use keys of **Layer 0** as Magic keys. These settings are stored in EEPROM so that retain your configure over power cycles.

To avoid configuring accidentally additive salt key `KC_SPACE` also needs to be pressed along with the following configuration keys. The salt key is configurable in `config.h`. See [tmk_core/common/bootmagic.h](tmk_core/common/bootmagic.h).

#### General
- Skip reading EEPROM to start with default configuration(`ESC`)
- Clear configuration stored in EEPROM to reset configuration(`Backspace`)

#### Bootloader
- Kick up Bootloader(`B`)

#### Debug
- Debug enable(`D`)
- Debug matrix enable(`D`+`X`)
- Debug keyboard enable(`D`+`K`)
- Debug mouse enable(`D`+`M`)

#### Keymap
- Swap Control and CapsLock(`Left Control`)
- Change CapsLock to Control(`Caps Lock`)
- Swap LeftAlt and Gui(`Left Alt`)
- Swap RightAlt and Gui(`Right Alt`)
- Disable Gui(`Left Gui`)
- Swap Grave and Escape(`Grave`)
- Swap BackSlash and BackSpace(`Back Slash`)
- Enable NKRO on boot(`N`)

#### Default Layer
- Set Default Layer to 0(`0`)
- Set Default Layer to 1(`1`)
- Set Default Layer to 2(`2`)
- Set Default Layer to 3(`3`)
- Set Default Layer to 4(`4`)
- Set Default Layer to 5(`5`)
- Set Default Layer to 6(`6`)
- Set Default Layer to 7(`7`)



Mechanical Locking support
--------------------------
This feature makes it possible for you to use mechanical locking switch for `CapsLock`, `NumLock` 
or `ScrollLock`. To enable this feature define these macros in `config.h` and use `KC_LCAP`, `KC_LN
UM` or `KC_LSCR` in keymap for locking key instead of normal `KC_CAPS`, `KC_NLCK` or `KC_SLCK`. Res
ync option tries to keep switch state consistent with keyboard LED state.
 
    #define LOCKING_SUPPORT_ENABLE
    #define LOCKING_RESYNC_ENABLE



Start Your Own Project
-----------------------
**TBD**



Debugging
--------
Use PJRC's `hid_listen` to see debug messages. You can use the tool for debug even if firmware use LUFA stack.

You can use xprintf() to display debug info on `hid_listen`, see `tmk_core/common/xprintf.h`.
